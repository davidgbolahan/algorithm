Algorithm to determine the length of the sentense.
Solution
Start the Algorithm
get the sentence ="This is my Algorithm project".
get the value length =0
Count the no of characters in the sentence
Then for each Count at period
Get the final value of length 
End 

Algorithm to determine the number of words in the sentence.
Start
get a variable word=0
count the number of strings in sentence
for each count let word =word + 1
end the count at the period
get the final value of word 
end

Algorithm
Start
get the sentence='Thisis my Algorithmproject'.
get a variable each=0
get a variable vowels= A, E, I, O, U 
count the number of vowels in sentence
In each count let each =each+1
end the count at the period
get the final value of each ]
end
